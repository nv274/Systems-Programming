My name is Nandish Verma.
I don't have a partner for this project.
I wasn't able to implement all the described features.
I could not check for the different capitalized versions of words, I thought I could using strcmp, but it was flawed.
To address punctuation, I "cleaned" words from the start and back in the wordlookup function.
If a given argument was a directory, it would be passed to the traverse function and return a char array of all txt files in that directory.
Words are looked up using binary search on a dictionary array where each entry is aligned by 64 bytes.
