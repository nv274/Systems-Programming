If you could have any animal as a pet, no matter how wild or fantastical, what would it be?
Imagine a pizza where the crust is made entirely out of cheese!
If chairs could talk, what stories would they tell about us?
What if clouds were fluffy enough to sleep on? Would we ever come down?
Sometimes I wonder if fish think they're flying in their own type of sky.
